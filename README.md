# Fedex Web Coding Challenge

This project is the result of a coding challenge for a role at FedEx, it contains a signup form to create a user account.

## Some rules
* Use the latest version of Angular in combination with TypeScript.
* UX/UI can be based on a CSS Framework (or do it yourself with minimal effort).
* You can target browsers that support ES6. Do not worry about supporting old browser versions.
* Make your solution available on GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket.


## Development server

Make sure you've installed Node and NPM on your computer. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
